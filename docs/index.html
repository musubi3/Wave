            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Wave is a simple 2D game I developed in Java during my junior year of high school. The project began as a
                tutorial by <a href="https://youtu.be/1gir2R7G9ws?si=3tcz1yNh1YVnM3s3" target="_blank">RealTutsGML</a>
                on YouTube, which provided the foundation for the core mechanics. From there, I extended the game by
                implementing custom features, original visual elements, and gameplay enhancements.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to try it out, you can download the latest version of the game for Windows <a
                    href="https://github.com/musubi3/Wave/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <section id="gameplay" class="project-section">
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>In Wave, you control the blue circle, navigating through waves of increasingly difficult enemy
                projectiles. Your objective is simple: survive as long as possible by dodging various types of enemies,
                each with distinct behaviors:</p>

            <ul class="enemy-list">
                <li><strong>Basic enemies</strong> move at a slower pace and bounce predictably.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast enemies</strong> have increased speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard enemies</strong> bounce unpredictably.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart enemies</strong> track your movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Boss enemies</strong> fires fast projectiles at you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Taking a hit reduces your health, but you'll occasionally get a chance to recover—health packs spawn
                periodically, and collecting them restores a portion of your HP. You'll also find coins, which can be
                used to unlock new skins and upgrades to enhance your gameplay experience.</p>

        <section id="upgrades" class="project-section">
            <h2>Upgrades</h2>
            <p>As you collect coins throughout the game, you can spend them on upgrades to improve your chances of
                survival. The current upgrade options include:</p>

            <div class="feature-grid">
                <div class="card feature-item">
                    <h3>Health Upgrade</h3>
                    <p>Increases your maximum health, allowing you to withstand more enemy hits.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card feature-item">
                    <h3>Speed Upgrade</h3>
                    <p>Boosts your movement speed, making it easier to dodge enemies and collect items.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>These upgrades add a strategic layer to the game, allowing players to tailor their playstyle as they
                progress through tougher waves.</p>

        <section id="skins" class="project-section">
            <h2>Skins</h2>
            <p>Customize your character's appearance with unlockable skins earned through gameplay. As you collect
                coins, you can choose from a variety of visual styles, including:</p>

            <ul class="skin-list">
                <li><strong>Basic Blue:</strong><br>The classic look.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Ball:</strong><br>A glowing, high-energy effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Rasengan:</strong><br>Inspired by the iconic anime move.</li>
                <li><strong>Pyro Ball:</strong><br>A fiery, fast-moving variant.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Skins are purely cosmetic and allow you to personalize your experience while dodging waves of enemies.
            </p>

        <section id="saves" class="project-section">
            <h2>Saves</h2>
            <p>Wave includes a save system that allows players to maintain progress across sessions. Each save profile
                stores:</p>

            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li class="tag">Unlocked skins</li>
                <li class="tag">High scores</li>
                <li class="tag">Purchased upgrades</li>
                <li class="tag">Custom settings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can create and load multiple profiles, making it easy to track different playstyles or share the game
                with others on the same device.</p>

        <section id="multiplayer" class="project-section">
            <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
            <p>Wave also features local multiplayer, allowing two players to play simultaneously on the same device.
                Player 1 controls their character using the WASD keys, while Player 2 uses the arrow keys. Dodge enemies
                together or compete for high scores in fast-paced cooperative gameplay.</p>

            <h2>Settings</h2>
            <p>Tailor the game to your preferences with adjustable settings including light or dark mode, difficulty
                levels (normal or hard), and audio controls for music, sound effects, and background songs.</p>
