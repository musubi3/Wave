# About
Wave is a simple 2D game I developed in Java during my senior year of high school. The project began as a tutorial by <a href="https://youtu.be/1gir2R7G9ws?si=3tcz1yNh1YVnM3s3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealTutsGML</a> on YouTube, which provided the foundation for the core mechanics. From there, I extended the game by implementing custom features, original visual elements, and gameplay enhancements.

If you'd like to try it out, you can download the Windows version <a href="https://github.com/musubi3/Wave/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

# Gameplay
In Wave, you control the blue circle, navigating through waves of increasingly difficult enemy projectiles. Your objective is simple: survive as long as possible by dodging various types of enemies, each with distinct behaviors:

- **Basic enemies** move at a slower pace and bounce predictably.
- **Fast enemies** have increased speed.
- **Hard enemies** bounce unpredictably.
- **Smart enemies** track your movements.
- **Boss enemies** fires fast projectiles at you.

Taking a hit reduces your health, but you’ll occasionally get a chance to recover—health packs spawn periodically, and collecting them restores a portion of your HP. You’ll also find coins, which can be used to unlock new skins and upgrades to enhance your gameplay experience.

# Upgrades
As you collect coins throughout the game, you can spend them on upgrades to improve your chances of survival. The current upgrade options include:

- **Health Upgrade:**<br>Increases your maximum health, allowing you to withstand more enemy hits.

- **Speed Upgrade:**<br>Boosts your movement speed, making it easier to dodge enemies and collect items.

These upgrades add a strategic layer to the game, allowing players to tailor their playstyle as they progress through tougher waves.

# Skins
Customize your character’s appearance with unlockable skins earned through gameplay. As you collect coins, you can choose from a variety of visual styles, including:

- **Basic Blue:** The classic look.
- **Energy Ball:** A glowing, high-energy effect.
- **Rasengan:** Inspired by the iconic anime move.
- **Pyro Ball:** A fiery, fast-moving variant.

Skins are purely cosmetic and allow you to personalize your experience while dodging waves of enemies.

# Saves
Wave includes a save system that allows players to maintain progress across sessions. Each save profile stores:

- Unlocked skins
- High scores
- Purchased upgrades
- Custom settings

You can create and load multiple profiles, making it easy to track different playstyles or share the game with others on the same device.

# Multiplayer
Wave also features local multiplayer, allowing two players to play simultaneously on the same device. Player 1 controls their character using the WASD keys, while Player 2 uses the arrow keys. Dodge enemies together or compete for high scores in fast-paced cooperative gameplay.
